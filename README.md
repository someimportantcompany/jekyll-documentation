# jekyll-documentation

Heavily based on [Just-The-Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) with some key differences:

- No `Gemfile`/additional Gems beyond what Github Pages includes by default.
- No search features.
- Hide the sidebar using YAML config, so configurable on a per-site instance.
